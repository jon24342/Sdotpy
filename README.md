This program is a discord bot RAT (Remote Access Trojan) that is slightly inspired off PySilon.   

I made this for fun bc im board.

Yes it's technicaly malware.

This program has the added bonus of not needing admin permisions(for windows, idk about mac and linux)

From what I researched this should only support 1 bot conection at a time but from testing i learned it can support 3 but maybe more

List of commands:

  Define target:
  
  When using this RAT you must use the id prefix after the command to direct the bot to activate when called, example: !test jimmy
  
  * "target id"(The name that shows when the bot is activated)= sends only to the target id and the prefix "dir" will be used when replying to the server
    
  * all = send to all active bots and no prefix will be used only sending the command output string
  
  * other/blank/mistype = print 0 / does nothing 
___
  Commands:
  
   The target must be called after the command or the command will be nullifyed. !example jimmy afterstring {file atachment}
    
   Certain commands suport and afterstring which changes the ouput this will be indecated below with (str)
    
   Certain commands require a file atachment (example: openimg) if not provided the desired output will not be achived, they will be indecated with (file)
